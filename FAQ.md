# Frequently Asked Questions

These are questions that the Shrimple Technologies team has been asked multiple times, and are added here for easier reference.

## Does Ouch Browser support Windows?

**No.** This is not a decision made by Shrimple Technologies, but the fact that Ouch Browser's core dependency, WebKitGTK, has very unclear support for Windows, as it's last release for Windows was in the `2.7` trilogy.

## When will Ouch Browser be stable?

**We do not know,** but it is expected to be stabilized by mid-2025.

## Can you add this feature?

**Maybe.** We are a small development team, and we cannot implement all features quickly. If you would still like to send your feature request, you may do it on our [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~shrimple/shrimple).

## Where are the AI features?

It is a web browser, **there aren't any.**

## Does Ouch Browser support ARM64 or 32-bit architectures?

For ARM64 architectures, **maybe.** At first, this was a personal decision from Shrimple Technologies, but however, when actually preparing to do this, there were multiple errors, including the fact that a core dependency could not be cross-compiled. We are planning on trying this again soon.



As for 32-bit architectures, **no.**
